<!-- 
A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.

Every click will alternate between marking an X and O

Upon marking of an individual cell, use javascript to add a class to each cell to display separate colors.

A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.

Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board. -->


<!-- How to get started -->

<!-- Construct a index.html to be your starting point on this project. Add your necessary html tags, including script and link tags to link to your javascript and css respecively.

Before you even start working with javascript, construct the gameboard. The gameboard page should include the 3x3 grid (of divs), and at minimum a reset button. Using id and class on clickable elements will help you wire this up in javascript afterwards.

Javascript portion will be next.

Locate the element first to use it within your app. Think about using:

getElementById, 
getElementsByClassName, 
querySelector, or 
querySelectorAll 

to locate your target elements. Try this in your console to make sure your selection works.

After finding the elements, start writing logic to use an event listener for click against those elements.

You will also need a variable to keep track of moves. 
This will be used to indicate whether or not to draw an X or an O.
