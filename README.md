# Tic-Tac-Toe Grading Rubric

## HTML
- [ ] proper DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags
- [ ] good indentation
- [ ] each id is only used once
- [ ] classes are applied on elements
- [ ] links to CSS file, doesn't use `style` attribute
- [ ] links to JS file, doesn't embed JavaScript

## CSS

## JavaScript
- [ ] no syntax errors
- [ ] good indentation
- [ ] good variable names
- [ ] minimal global variables
- [ ] handles DOM loading without problems
- [ ] functions have good scope (variables aren't declared outside functions)
- [ ] functions use parameters
- [ ] functions are used to reduce redundancy

## Gameplay Requirements
- [ ] clicking on a box sets X or O
- [ ] alternating clicks switches between X and O
- [ ] X and O boxes display as different colors
